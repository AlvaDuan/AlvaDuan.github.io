 - **[The Underemployment Trap](https://jie-duan.com/files/DurDep.pdf), with [Paul Jackson](https://www.paulgjackson.com/)**<br>

<div class="abstract-text">
Many college graduates are underemployed, i.e., work in occupations that do not require a college degree. We document that underemployed workers are less likely to transition to a college occupation the longer they are underemployed and that longer underemployment histories are associated with lower wages in college occupations. To explain these findings, we develop a directed search model with unobserved heterogeneity, occupation-specific human capital, heterogeneous firms, and on the job search. Workers are uncertain about their suitability for college jobs and learn through search. Underemployment is generated by search and informational frictions as workers with a low expected job-finding probability in college occupations self-select into underemployment. Once underemployed, workers' college occupation-specific human capital decays. A quantitative decomposition shows that unobserved heterogeneity explains nearly 97% of the duration dependence in underemployment, and that information frictions play a significant role in both the existence of underemployment and the resulting duration dependence.

- <strong>Internet Linkage and International Trade: From the Perspective of Risk Alleviation, with <a href="http://zengxi-hu.com/">Zengxi Hu</a>, <i>Revise and Resubmit</i></strong>  

<div class="abstract-text">
Although the impact of the Internet on trade has been extensively researched, little attention has been given to its role in mitigating risks. This study, which adopted inter-domain hyperlinks as a proxy for measuring Internet linkage in 2009, sheds light on a new channel of risk reduction that facilitates exports through the Internet. The paper first develops a gravity model that incorporates export risk to theoretically demonstrate the relationship between Internet linkage and risk. Next, the study empirically examines the positive impact of Internet linkage on exports, revealing that doubling the intensity of Internet linkage results in a 27.8% increase in exports. Additionally, the research employs multiple techniques to address potential endogeneity issues such as reverse causality, omitted variables, and time-variant factors. Finally, the study confirms the risk-alleviation mechanism of Internet linkage by showing consistent evidence at both the country-level and product-level, indicating that importers and products that are more vulnerable to risk stand to benefit the most from Internet linkage.
